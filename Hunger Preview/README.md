Hunger Preview
--------------

For now, using [Hunger Preview](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/bvt-hunger-preview)
from Better Vanilla Tweaks because, well, it's better than the Vanilla Tweaks version

Planned changes: (some already done in BVT)

- Remove code related to Brewing Guide, if using Vanilla Tweaks version
- Include all Minecraft languages
- Generate food names from original Minecraft vanilla assets
- Read nutrition and saturation food data from Minecraft source code
- Add Status Effects for Raw Chicken, Rotten Flesh, etc
- Optimize all images with PNGCrush
